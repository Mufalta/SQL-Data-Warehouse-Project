# Data Warehouse Hands-on Project

Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to the **Data Warehouse Project**!
First of all, a huge thanks to **Baraa Khatib Salkini** for inspiring me to build this modern data warehouse using SQL Server. This project demonstrates how to create a modern data warehouse for data analytics purposes. It closely reflects the type of projects that data engineers work on in real-world scenarios.
